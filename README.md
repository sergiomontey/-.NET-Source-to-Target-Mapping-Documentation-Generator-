Yes, absolutely!

I've taken the entire README content and wrapped it in a single markdown code block so you can easily copy the text and save it as a file named README.md for your GitHub repository.

> **A professional desktop application for ETL consultants** - Eliminate hours of manual Excel work by providing an intuitive GUI for documenting complex data mappings.

---

## 🎯 Overview

STTM Gen is a **.NET MAUI** desktop application designed specifically for **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **Data Migration** consultants. It provides a structured, guided, and persistent way to document the source-to-target mapping process, transforming the usual error-prone manual Excel task into a streamlined, professional workflow.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **✅ Visual Mapping Form**: Intuitive form entry for documenting `Source Table/Column` $\to$ `Target Table/Column`.
* **💡 Transformation Logic Capture**: Dedicated multi-line entry for documenting complex business logic and SQL/code transformations.
* **📑 Business Rule Documentation**: Capture and link specific data quality or business validation rules to each mapping.
* **🔢 Data Type Selection**: Dropdown selectors for defining and confirming target data types.
* **💾 JSON Project Persistence**: **Save** and **Load** entire mapping projects to a single, readable `.sttm.json` file.
* **📊 Real-time Table View**: A live, interactive DataGrid/CollectionView displaying all documented mappings.
* **📄 Professional Excel Export**: Generate a highly formatted, client-ready **Excel** document (using **ClosedXML**) with clear headings, borders, and text wrapping.
* **🗑️ Delete & Clear**: Simple functionality for managing (editing, deleting, clearing) mapping entries.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

STTM Gen is built with **.NET MAUI** and C\#.

### Prerequisites

* **.NET 8 SDK** (or newer)
* **Visual Studio 2022** (Community or higher) with the **.NET Multi-platform App UI development** workload installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/sttm-documentation-generator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/sttm-documentation-generator.git)
cd sttm-documentation-generator
2. Restore Dependencies

The dependencies (such as ClosedXML for Excel export) will be automatically restored by Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.

Bash
dotnet restore
3. Run the Application

You can run the application against a specific target platform (e.g., Windows).

Bash
# Run for Windows
dotnet build -t:Run -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0
Alternatively, open the solution in Visual Studio and press F5.

4. Start Documenting

Enter the Source Table and Source Column details.

Enter the Target Table and Target Column details.

Document the Transformation Logic and Business Rules.

Click "Add Mapping" to update the table view.

Click "Export to Excel" to generate the final deliverable!

🏗️ Architecture
The application strictly follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to ensure maintainability, testability, and a clear separation of UI logic from business logic.
